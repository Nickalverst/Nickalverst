### :wave: Hi there
My name is Nicolas. My passion for digital games and computers has led me to study Digital Games Technology at Mackenzie Presbyterian University, in which I have been delving especially into software development with C#, game development tools such as the Unity game engine, and level design. This passion has also driven me to study Computer Engineering at the Federal University of Technology - Paran√°, where I am building a solid computer science and mathematics foundation. In addition to curricular studies, I have been deepening my knowledge about related topics, such as digital modelling and design, to better understand the game design process. Part of the results of these studies can be found on GitHub, both in repositories of personal and guided practical projects.
