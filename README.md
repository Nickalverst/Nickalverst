### :wave: Hi there
My name is Nicolas and I am a Digital Games Technology undergraduate student at Universidade Presbiteriana Mackenzie, where I focus my studies at game design and computer programming in C# and JavaScript. In addition to curricular studies, I have been deepening my knowledge about related technologies, such as digital modeling and design, HTML and CSS, and emerging ones, such as artificial intelligence and ray tracing.
